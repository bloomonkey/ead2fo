Description
-----------

ead2fo provides XSLT stylesheets to convert Encoded Archival Description 
(EAD) XML documents to XSL-FO. XSL-FO can be used as input to a rendering 
engine (e.g. Apache FOP) to generate print formatted (e.g. PDF) copies. 


Current capability is to output a version with fairly minimal styling, to 
enable users to create a clone/fork/branch that they can then customize to 
apply their own institutional branding.

Latest Version
--------------

The latest version is available from:
http://github.com/bloomonkey/ead2fo


Requirements / Dependencies
---------------------------

An XSLT processing engine of your choice.

OPTIONALLY: an XSL-FO rendering engine to create print formatted copies.

N.B. The XSLT has been tested with Apache FOP, which includes both XSLT 
and XSL-FO processing engines. Apache FOP is available from:
<http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop>


Documentation
-------------

Currently the only documentation that exists is contained within this 
README file, and XML comments within the XSLT sheets themselves.


	Using the XSLT with Apache FOP
	------------------------------
	
EADFILE is the path to your EAD file, OUTFILE is the path to the file to 
create. You should give the OUTFILE a file extension appropriate to output 
type, as per the examples. Please note that the generate XSL-FO has been 
optimized for PDF, which can lead to some odd behavior in plain and rich 
text formats, particularly with very large input files.

To create a PDF:
fop -xsl ead2fo.xsl -xml EADFILE -pdf OUTFILE.pdf

To create Rich-Text Format (RTF):
fop -xsl ead2fo.xsl -xml EADFILE -rtf OUTFILE.rtf

To create Plain-Text:
fop -xsl ead2fo.xsl -xml EADFILE -txt OUTFILE.txt

To create PostScript:
fop -xsl ead2fo.xsl -xml EADFILE -ps OUTFILE.ps
